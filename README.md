## Podcast

Inspired by the recent [annoucement](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/podcast-destination-on-youtube-music/) that Google Podcast is shutting down, I want to create an upgraded version of that podcast app. This aims to be a easy-to-use, AI-powered, and sleek looking podcast app

Currently only avaliable in web but I plan to expand to mobile in the future.
